# Pyber-Ride-Sharing
This project is to analyze data of a ride sharing startup company.  


# Rationale 
As the ride sharing bonanza continues, while also seeing the success of the notable players like Uber and Lyft, this project is to analyze the data of a startup ride sharing company.  Since you have access to the company's complete recordset of rides, the objectice is to analyze the information every active diver, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.  

A Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between for key variables: 
  - Average Fare ($) Per City
  - Total Number of Riders Per City
  - Total Number of Drivers Per City
  - City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
  
Three pie charts:
  - % of Total Fares by City Type
  - % of Total Rides by City Type
  - % of Total Drivers by City Type

  - Rural riders tend to take significantly higher cost, although fewer, trips than Urban or Suburban riders.
  - While comprising of roughly 35% of all rides and fares, Suburban and Rural cities afford only 22% of Pyber's total driver population.
